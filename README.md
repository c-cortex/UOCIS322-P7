RESTful API-services
Brevet time calculator with AJAX, MongoDB, and a RESTful API!
1. Page will ask user:
    - If they want to display the times in CSV or JSON.
    - The number of times they want to display.
    - If they want to list all, open only, or close only times.
2. Once form is summited, the data will be used to redirect to appropriate URL.
3. Finally get the list of appropriate control times based on data and mongo database.

Login and Registration
Adding authentication and user interface to brevet time calculator service
1. Prompted to create an account to use the calculator.
2. Go to register and create an account.
3. Login currently does not work for created accounts, but you can login like the initial code allowed using the username alex, bob, or jim with any password.
4. Can now use calculator, see secret page and logout.
5. *** The database is only there because the login service is not working and I wanted to show that the registered users are actually being stored in a data base. ***
